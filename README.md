# GTA V Gravity Gun wannabe.

Hey there! You've just stumbled upon a fun little FiveM script. Think Half-Life 2, but in the streets of Los Santos.

## How Do I Get This On My Server?

It's a piece of cake. Just pop the `GravityGun` folder in your server's resources directory. Then, add `ensure GravityGun` to your `server.cfg`. Voila, you're done!

## How Do I Use This?

Equip your trusty pistol and free aim at an entity. Hit E to start controlling the entity. The scroll wheel will let you adjust how far the entity is from you. Hit E again when you're ready to let the entity go.
